This is my MC68000 first project.


# Computer.

The idea behind this project is to develog a minicomputer as if I was in 1980.
I will try to use chips of that era except for memory because the memories of
that time were small in storage quantity.


I know that a concept of a minicomputer is not an exact science, so it is not
easy to reach a consensus on the subject, so I will use a definition that I found
very pertinent at the time of the reign of minicomputers. Since data storage
and memory were very expensive at that time, a minicomputer for its price had
to have many of these components.
