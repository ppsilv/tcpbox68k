. Understand the ST16C554 Registers:
Baud Rate Divisor: The ST16C554 uses a divisor to calculate the baud rate. The formula is: Baud Rate = Main Clock Frequency / (16 * Divisor).
Line Control Register (LCR): Configures data format (number of data bits, stop bits, parity).
Interrupt Enable Register (IER): Enables/disables various interrupt sources.
Interrupt Identification Register (IIR): Indicates the source of an interrupt.
FIFO Control Register (FCR): Enables and configures the FIFO buffers.
Line Status Register (LSR): Provides information about the status of the UART, such as data available, transmit holding register empty, etc.
Modem Control Register (MCR): Controls modem interface signals.
Scratch Register (SCR): A general-purpose register for storing temporary data.
